Environment Setup: Installed Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, bcrypt, and JWT. Configured .env.local with secrets and keys.

Authentication: Implemented Register, Login, Logout, and User Profile APIs with JWT and bcrypt password hashing.

Frontend: Built Login, Register, and Dashboard pages with form validation, API integration, and client-side routing.

Security: Used HTTP-only cookies for JWT, hashed passwords, and handled errors safely.

Testing: Verified full authentication flow (register → login → dashboard → logout) works and cookies are managed correctly.
